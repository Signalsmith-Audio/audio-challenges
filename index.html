		<h1>Audio Challenges</h1>
		
		<p>This project aims to be a set of audio-related challenges to help build an intuitive link between maths, code and sound.</p>
		<p>This is a <em>very</em> early-stage project.  The goals are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>natural progression of difficulty and complexity</li>
			<li>can be completed in any language</li>
			<li>nice displays of the altered waveform and spectrum</li>
			<li>results checked by dropping a WAV file into the browser for analysis</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>There is currently only one challenge:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="basic-html-client/?id=v1/fixed-gain">multiply everything by a constant</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>How you can help</h2>
		<p>We'd <em>love</em> some help on this, in many different ways.  Please see the <a href="https://github.com/Signalsmith-Audio/audio-challenges">README on GitHub</a> for some ways you can join in.</p>
